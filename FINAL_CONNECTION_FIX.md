2. **Transfer** new APK to your Xiaomi device
3. **Install** the APK (enable "Unknown sources" if needed)

### **Step 2: Xiaomi-Specific Setup**
When you first open the app, it will request:

   - Tap "Allow" when prompted
   - Or go to Settings → Battery → App battery saver → Select app → No restrictions

2. **MIUI Autostart Permission**:
   - Settings → Apps → Manage apps → Remote Control Guest → Autostart → Enable

3. **Background App Limit**:
   - Settings → Apps → Manage apps → Remote Control Guest → Other permissions → Background activity → Allow

### **Step 3: Start Remote Control**
1. **Open** "Remote Control Guest" app
2. **Grant** any remaining permissions
3. **Tap "START REMOTE CONTROL"**
4. **Grant screen recording** permission
5. **Look for Session Code** - should show: `Session Code: 123456`

### **Step 4: Connect from Web**
1. **Open browser** to: http://192.168.137.3:3000
2. **Enter the 6-digit code** from your phone
3. **Click "Connect"**
4. **Success!** - You should see your phone screen in browser

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If App Still Closes on Xiaomi:**
1. Open **Security** app → **Permissions** → **Autostart** → Enable for "Remote Control Guest"
2. **Settings** → **Battery & performance** → **Background app settings** → Choose apps → Enable for "Remote Control Guest"
3. **Settings** → **Apps** → **Dual apps** → Make sure it's disabled for this app

### **If Session Code Still Doesn't Show:**
1. Check that your devices are on the **same WiFi network**
2. Your phone should connect to: `192.168.137.3:3001`
3. Check Android logs: `adb logcat | grep -E "(WebSocketService|MainActivity)"`

### **If Connection Fails:**
1. **Restart both servers** (already running)
2. **Check firewall** on Mac - may need to allow port 3001
3. **Verify IP**: Run `ifconfig | grep "inet "` to confirm Mac IP is still `192.168.137.3`

## 🎯 **Expected Success Flow**

1. **Install APK** → App opens with proper icon ✅
2. **Grant permissions** → No infinite loops ✅  
3. **Start remote control** → Session code appears immediately ✅
4. **Enter code in web** → Connection established ✅
5. **View phone screen** → Remote control works ✅
6. **App stays alive** → No auto-close on Xiaomi ✅
