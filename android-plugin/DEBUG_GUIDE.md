## 🔧 Testing Steps

### 1. Install Updated APK
```bash
# Transfer to your mobile device and install
# The APK should now open without crashing
```

### 2. Test App Launch
1. **Open the app** - should show the main interface (not a white screen)
2. **Check UI elements**:
   - "Remote Control Guest" header
   - Status text showing "🔴 Remote Control Inactive" 
   - "Start Remote Control" button
   - "Accessibility Settings" button

### 3. Grant Permissions
The app will request these permissions:
- **Internet access** (automatic)
- **Screen recording** (when you tap "Start Remote Control")
- **Accessibility service** (via Settings > Accessibility)
- **System overlay** (if needed)

### 4. Test Connection Flow
1. **Tap "Start Remote Control"**
2. **Accept screen recording permission**
3. **Look for session code** (6-digit number)
4. **Check network connection** to your computer

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### App Still Crashes?
If the app still shows a white screen and crashes:

1. **Check device logs** (if you have ADB access):
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "(FATAL|AndroidRuntime|RemoteControl)"
```

2. **Try these debugging steps**:
   - Restart your mobile device
   - Clear app data: Settings > Apps > Remote Control Guest > Storage > Clear Data
   - Ensure you're using the latest APK from today's build

### No Session Code Appears?
If the app opens but doesn't generate a session code:

1. **Check network connection**:
   - Ensure mobile device is on same WiFi as your computer
   - Test: can you access `http://192.168.90.170:3001/health` from mobile browser?

2. **Check server status**:
   - Backend should be running on your computer
   - Web interface should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Check app permissions**:
   - All permissions granted?
   - Accessibility service enabled?

### Connection Failed?
If session code appears but web interface can't connect:

1. **Verify session code** - enter exactly as shown (6 digits)
2. **Check backend logs** - look for connection attempts
3. **Try refreshing** the web interface
4. **Restart services** if needed

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### ✅ App Launch Success:
- App opens to main screen (no white screen/crash)
- Shows "Remote Control Guest" title
- Shows current status: "🔴 Remote Control Inactive"
- Buttons are clickable and responsive

### ✅ Permission Flow:
1. Tap "Start Remote Control"
2. System asks for screen recording permission
3. Accept permission
4. App shows "🟢 Remote Control Active"
5. 6-digit session code appears
6. Status updates to "Waiting for Controller"

### ✅ Connection Success:
1. Enter session code in web interface
2. Web interface shows "Connected to session XXXXXX"
3. Mobile screen appears in web browser
4. Touch/click events work bidirectionally

## 🔄 If Problems Persist

### Rebuild with Debug Info:
```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/murad/android-plugin
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug --info --stacktrace
```

### Check Device Compatibility:
- **Minimum Android Version**: 8.0 (API 26)
- **Required Features**: Screen recording, Accessibility services
- **Architecture**: ARM64/x86_64 (most modern devices)

### Alternative Testing:
Try the web interface with a test session code first:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try entering any 6-digit code (like "123456")
3. Check if the interface responds (even if no session exists)

---

**Next Steps**: Install the updated APK and test following the steps above. The SessionManager initialization fix should resolve the white screen/crash issue.
