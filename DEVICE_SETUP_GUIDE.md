## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **üö® ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE POPUP ISSUE - FIXED**

If you're getting repeated popups asking to enable accessibility service:

**üì± Updated APK Solution:**
1. **Install the latest APK** (just rebuilt with fixes)
2. The app now **detects accessibility service better**
3. **Warnings instead of blocking** - app will warn but let you proceed
4. **Debug logging** - check Android logs to see what's happening

**üîß Manual Steps:**
1. **Uninstall** the old app completely
2. **Install** the new APK
3. **Enable accessibility service**:
   - Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Downloaded Apps
   - Find **"Remote Control Guest"**
   - Toggle **ON**
   - Confirm **"OK"**
4. **Force close and reopen** the app
5. Try **"Start Remote Control"** again

**üîç Debugging Steps:**
If still having issues, you can check the Android logs:
```bash
# Connect your device and run:
adb logcat -s MainActivity:D RemoteControlAccessibility:D
```

This will show you exactly what the app is detecting.

### If Buttons Still Don't Work:
1. **Force close** the app completely
2. **Reopen** the app
3. Try tapping **"Settings"** first to enable accessibility
4. Then try **"Start Remote Control"**

### If App Icon Still Shows as White Circle:
1. **Uninstall** the old app completely
2. **Restart** your device
3. **Reinstall** the new APK

### If Session Code Doesn't Appear:
1. Check **WiFi connection**
2. Verify backend is running: http://192.168.90.170:3001/health
3. Check app permissions are all granted

### Connection Issues:
1. **Same WiFi**: Ensure both devices on same network
2. **Firewall**: Mac firewall might block connections
