# Final Connection Test Guide

## System Status ✅
- **Backend Server**: Running on port 3001 (http://192.168.1.5:3001)
- **Web Interface**: Running on port 3000 (http://192.168.1.5:3000)
- **Updated APK**: Built with correct IP address (192.168.1.5:3001)
- **CORS Configuration**: Includes 192.168.1.5 for all necessary ports

## Pre-Test Checklist
- [ ] Backend server is running (check terminal output)
- [ ] Web interface is accessible in browser
- [ ] Android device is connected to the same WiFi network (192.168.1.x)
- [ ] Updated APK is installed on Android device

## Testing Steps

### 1. Install Updated APK on Android Device
```bash
# Transfer the APK to your Android device
adb install -r /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/murad/android-plugin/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 2. Start the Android App
1. Launch "Remote Control Guest" app on Android device
2. Grant all requested permissions:
   - Camera access (for screen capture)
   - Overlay permission (for control overlay)
   - Accessibility service (for touch injection)
3. Tap "Start Service" to begin the remote control session

### 3. Connect from Web Interface
1. Open http://192.168.1.5:3000 in your browser
2. The session code should automatically appear (generated by Android app)
3. Click "Connect" to establish the connection

### 4. Expected Results
- ✅ Android app shows "Connected" status
- ✅ Web interface displays live screen from Android device
- ✅ Mouse clicks on web interface control the Android device
- ✅ Real-time screen sharing with minimal latency

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails:
1. **Check Network**: Ensure both devices are on 192.168.1.x network
2. **Check Firewall**: Mac firewall might be blocking ports 3000/3001
3. **Check App Permissions**: Android app needs all permissions granted
4. **Check Logs**: Look at backend terminal for connection errors

### Common Issues:
- **"Failed to connect"**: Usually means IP address mismatch or network issue
- **"Permission denied"**: Android permissions not properly granted
- **"Screen capture failed"**: MediaProjection permission not granted
- **"No session code"**: WebSocket connection to backend failed

## Network Information
- **Mac IP**: 192.168.1.5
- **Backend Port**: 3001
- **Web Interface Port**: 3000
- **WebSocket URL**: ws://192.168.1.5:3001

## Next Steps After Successful Test
1. Document the working configuration
2. Create user-friendly setup guides
3. Consider packaging as installer/deployment scripts
4. Add error handling improvements
5. Optimize performance and latency
