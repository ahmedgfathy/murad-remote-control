# 🚀 SIMPLIFIED APK - ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE BYPASSED

## ✅ What I Fixed

### **Problem**: 
App was getting stuck requesting permissions and checking accessibility service, preventing you from reaching the main screen capture functionality.

### **Solution**: 
**BYPASSED ALL PERMISSION CHECKS** - Now the app goes straight to screen capture when you tap "Start Remote Control".

## 🔧 What Changed in the New APK

### **Old Behavior**:
1. Tap "Start Remote Control" 
2. ❌ Check overlay permission
3. ❌ Check accessibility service 
4. ❌ Check camera/microphone/location permissions
5. ❌ Request all permissions one by one
6. 🔴 **GET STUCK** in permission loops

### **New Behavior**:
1. Tap "Start Remote Control"
2. ✅ **DIRECTLY** request screen capture permission
3. ✅ **THAT'S IT!** - No more permission loops

## 📱 New APK Location

```
/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/murad/android-plugin/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 🎯 What To Expect Now

1. **Install the new APK**
2. **Open the app** - should show "🔴 Remote Control Inactive - Tap Start"
3. **Tap "START REMOTE CONTROL"** - will immediately show Android's screen recording dialog
4. **Tap "Start now"** in the screen recording dialog
5. **SUCCESS!** - App should start the remote control service and show session code

## 🔥 Key Benefits

- ✅ **No more permission loops**
- ✅ **No more accessibility service checks**
- ✅ **Direct access to core functionality**
- ✅ **Faster setup process**

## 📋 Test Steps

1. Uninstall old app
2. Install new APK
3. Open app
4. Tap "START REMOTE CONTROL"
5. Grant screen recording when Android asks
6. **Should work!**

The app now focuses on the core functionality (screen capture) and skips all the problematic permission checks that were causing issues.

**Note**: You can still enable accessibility service manually if needed for touch control, but it won't block the app from working.
